=head1 NAME

Games::Neverhood::Scene - Holds all the data for a game scene

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor takes several named parameters, which are explained below.
It returns the new object.

 our $Nursery1 = Games::Neverhood::Scene->new(
     folder  => 'nursery_1',
     fps     => 24,
     bounds  => [ 100, 100, 500, 400 ],
     cursors => \&cursors_out,
     sprites => [
         { background => { ... }, ... },
         $Games::Neverhood::Klaymen,
     ],
 );

=head3 folder

 folder => 'nursery_1'
 folder => [ 'nursery', 1 ]

If this parameter is specified, every sprite that belongs to the scene will get it's folder value set to it, unless the sprite has a folder already.

If an array is specified, the elements will be joined with C<File::Spec->catfile> (C<'nursery/1'>).

=head3 fps

 fps => 24

The desired frames-per-second of the scene.
The sprites' frames will be updated at this speed.
Defaults to 24.

=head3 bounds

 bounds  => [ $left, $top, $right, $bottom ]

A 4 element list of the pixel values of the bounds.
If the bounds is specified, and is clicked within, and Klaymen is set to a sprite with a name that matches C<<  /^idle/ >>, Klaymen will walk to the C<x> coordinate clicked.

=head3 cursors

 cursors => sub { 0 }
 cursors => sub { $Games::Neverhood::Cursor::Left if $_[0] < 400 }
 cursors => \&cursors_out

A callback that is passed the C<x> and C<y> coordinates of where the cursor is as arguments, and should return a sprite object.
If C<undef> is returned, the default click cursor is used.
If 0 is returned, no cursor is used.
Defaults to C<return undef>

=head3 sprites

 sprites => [
     { background => { ... }, ... },
     $Games::Neverhood::Klaymen,
     ...
 ]

An ordered list of the scene's sprites.
They are drawn in order, so the sprites at the start of the list will be at the back, and the sprites at the end will be at the fore.
An anonymous hash is accepted, which will be turned into a sprite for you like this:

                              { background => { ... }, ... }

 Games::Neverhood::Sprite->new( background => { ... }, ... )

Sets the new current scene, calls C<load_sprites>, sets the new framerate.
Returns the scene.

=head2 load_sprites

 $Nursery1->load_sprites

Loads all images for the sprites of the scene, if they haven't already been loaded.

=head2 unload_sprites

 $Nursery1->unload_sprites

Forgets all the image data for the sprites of the scene, if they haven't already been unloaded.
Returns the scene.

=head2 cursor

If arguments are given, returns the event of the coordinates specified.
