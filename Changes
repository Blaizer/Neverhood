    Started working on this mess.



Here's a collection of my notes about how this game engine differs from the original game engine.

* major changes
- minor changes

GENERAL
- No fixed framerate (but everything but the cursor still moves at an FPS)
- No animation artefacts from bad dirty rects
- No one-frame palette glitch on scene change
- Scaling and letterboxing to any screen resolution
- All animations are loaded on scene change; no lag on playing animations
- If sounds don't load in time they may never get played; no lag on playing sounds
