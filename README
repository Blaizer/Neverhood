Neverhood is an open-source, SDL Perl remake of the 1996 "The Neverhood". It aims to make you feel like you're playing the original, but also to improve it in certain places. It should run on most modern systems, contact me if it doesn't work on yours.

I also hang out on the SDL IRC, and I might direct you there to chat.
