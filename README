Games::Neverhood
Blaise Roth

The game works without installing as long as you have the prerequisites. These are:

 Perl 5.10.0
 SDL 2.540
 File::ShareDir

Then just run:
 perl nhc.pl

To get the prerequisites and install:
 perl Build.PL
 ./Build installdeps
 ./Build
 ./Build test
 ./Build install

Once installed, run the game with:
 nhc

Press Alt-F4 at any time to quit.


Neverhood is an open-source, SDL Perl remake of the 1996 ``The Neverhood". It aims to make you feel like you're playing the original, but also to improve it in certain places. It should run on most modern systems, contact me if it doesn't work on yours.

I also hang out on the SDL IRC, and I might direct you there to chat.
