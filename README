  An engine for The Neverhood in Perl

Neverhood is going to be an open-source, Perl reimplementation of the 1996 "The
Neverhood". Not much is done yet, though, so don't expect to see much even if
you do manage to get it running.

A lot of what is done is based on the Neverhood ScummVM engine. That engine
recently merged with the master branch of the ScummVM GitHub repository so go
check it out!


INSTALLATION

You must install Neverhood before you can run the game. Run the following
commands:

 perl -MCPAN -e "install Alien::SDL2"
 perl Build.PL
 ./Build installdeps
 ./Build test
 ./Build install


RUNNING THE GAME

Run the game with:

 nhc

Press Alt-F4 at any time to quit.
