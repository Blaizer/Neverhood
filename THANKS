Thanks to:

Contributors to SDL Perl, for making it what it is today
As well as specifically FROGGS, kthakore and Alias for their help and/or praise

Programs/libraries:
The Neverhood
Perl

FRAPS                 losslessly capturing the video of the game, and being my fps indicator
Sony Vegas            losslessly saving the video as separate images
GIMP                  image editing and crunching with scripts
pngout                reducing the size of every PNG by ~10%
Game Audio Player     extracting all the files from the Neverhood BLBs
oggenc                converting the uncompressed audio to OGG Vorbis format
SMPlayer              playing the Smacker video
FFmpeg                having the Smacker codec

XeNTaX Forum      help with Game Audio Player
MultimediaWiki    very helpful pages on the BLB and Smacker formats
